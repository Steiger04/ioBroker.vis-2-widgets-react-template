# Vis 2 Energy widgets

This is only for development purposes, and it could be used as a basis for own vis-2 widgets' development.

This example consists of two projects: JavaScript (src-widgets-js) and TypeScript (src-widgets-ts).

** The typescript project is not yet finished! If someone can fix it. You are welcome. **


## Development
After all entries with `vis-widgets-react-template` are replaced to your adapter name in `package.json`, `io-package.json` 
and file `admin/vis-widgets-react-template.png` renamed too, you can start with renaming of widgets.

Some important places:
1. `io-package.json` => `common.visWidgets`
2. `src-widgets-js/modulefederation.config.js` from line 4
3. File `DemoWidget.jsx`

Files in directory `src-widgets-js` (`App.tsx`, `bootstrap.jsx`, `index.js`) are only for development mode and will not be used in production. 

By development, you can start the script from `src-widgets-js` folder with `npm run start` command,
and then on port 4173 you will see the demo widget.

For faster development, you can:
- start in src-widgets-js: `npm run start`
- write in object `system.adapter.vis-widgets-react-template.0`=>`common.visWidgets.vis2DemoWidget.url` to `http://localhost:4173/customWidgets.js`
- Press F5 in `iobroker.vis` web page
